I'm Caleigh (she/her).  I'm originally from Allentown, PA, and went to Lafayette College, majoring in Neuroscience and Spanish.

I've always had a passion for being creative, and I'm very excited to apply that creativity to the technology space.  I just completed a 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp at Tech Elevator, where I learned Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL and more.

I'm currently looking for a job as a junior developer, and working on some fun side projects, like Wine Buddy and Pok√©-pedia.
